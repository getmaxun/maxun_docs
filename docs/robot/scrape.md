# Scrape

Scrape lets you convert any webpage into **clean HTML**, **LLM-ready Markdown** and **capture screenshots**.
Just provide a URL, choose your output format, and Maxun handles the rest.

## How It Works

1. Enter the URL you want to scrape.  
2. Choose your output format  
   - **HTML**  
   - **Markdown**
   - **Visible part screenshot**
   - **Full page screenshot**
3. Run the robot.  

**Batch scraping** is coming soon, allowing you to process multiple URLs in a single run.

## When to Use Scrape
- Fast content extraction  
- Clean HTML or Markdown for an LLM  

If you need logins, interactions, pagination, or element-level data capture, use **Extract** instead.

## Using with SDK

Scrape is available through the <a href="/sdk/sdk-scrape">Maxun SDK</a> for programmatic usage and integration into your applications.
