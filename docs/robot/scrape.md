# Scrape

Scrape lets you convert any webpage into **clean HTML** or **LLM-ready Markdown**.
Just provide a URL, choose your output format, and Maxun handles the rest.

## How It Works

1. Enter the URL you want to scrape.  
2. Choose your output format  
   - **Clean HTML**  
   - **Markdown** (LLM-ready)  
3. Run the robot.  
4. Download the results or use them programmatically via API.

That's all.

## Output Formats

### Clean HTML  
- No ads  
- No scripts or styling  
- Inline noise removed  
- Structure preserved  
- Ideal for downstream processing or storage

### Markdown  
- Optimized for LLMs  
- Headings, lists, tables, links, and text extracted cleanly  
- Great for embeddings, summarization, and RAG workflows

Both formats are always available for every run.

## Features

- One-step scraping  
- Works on most public webpages  
- Consistent, clean output  
- API support  
- Cloud and OSS support  
- Scheduled runs
- Webhook support
- MCP support

**Batch scraping** is coming soon, allowing you to process multiple URLs in a single run.

## When to Use Scrape Robots

Use Scrape robots when you need:

- Fast content extraction  
- Clean HTML or Markdown for an LLM  
- Zero-configuration scraping  
- A simple URL-in → content-out workflow  

If you need logins, interactions, pagination, or element-level data capture, use **Extract robots** instead.
