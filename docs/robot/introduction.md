Maxun robots are automated tools that help you collect data from websites without writing any code. Think of them as your personal web assistants that can navigate websites, extract information, and organize data just like you would manually - but faster and more efficiently.

There are four types of robots, each designed for a different job.

### 1. Extract
Extract emulates real user behavior and captures structured data. No code required.
- Recorder Mode - Record your actions as you browse; Maxun turns them into a reusable extraction robot.
- AI Mode - Describe what you want in natural language and let LLM-powered extraction do the rest.


### 2. Scrape
Scrape converts full webpages into clean Markdown, HTML and can capture screenshots. Ideal for AI workflows, agents, and document processing. No code required.

### 3. Crawl
**Automatically discover and scrape multiple pages from websites.**
- Intelligent page discovery using sitemaps and link following
- Configurable crawl scope (domain, subdomain, or path)
- Filter pages with URL patterns
- Extract full content from every discovered page
- Perfect for documentation, blogs, and multi-page content

### 4. Search
**Perform web searches and scrape results automatically.**
- Search the web using DuckDuckGo
- Two modes: discover (metadata only) or scrape (full content)
- Time-based filters (day, week, month, year)
- Ideal for research, competitive analysis, and content aggregation
