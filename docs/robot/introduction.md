Maxun robots are automated tools that help you collect data from websites without writing any code. Think of them as your personal web assistants that can navigate websites, extract information, and organize data just like you would manually - but faster and more efficiently.

There are four types of robots, each designed for a different job.

### 1. Extract
Extract emulates real user behavior and captures structured data. No code required.
- Recorder Mode - Record your actions as you browse; Maxun turns them into a reusable extraction robot.
- AI Mode - Describe what you want in natural language and let LLM-powered extraction do the rest.


### 2. Scrape
Scrape converts full webpages into clean Markdown, HTML and can capture screenshots. Ideal for AI workflows, agents, and document processing. No code required.

### 3. Crawl
Crawl entire websites and extract content from every relevant page, with full control over scope and discovery.

### 4. Search
Run automated web searches to discover or scrape results, with support for time-based filters.

<!-- ## Robot Actions
Depending on the use-case, a robot should be configured to perform any of the following actions.

1. Capture List
2. Capture Text
3. Capture Screenshot
