Maxun robots are automated tools that help you collect data from websites without writing any code. Think of them as your personal web assistants that can navigate websites, extract information, and organize data just like you would manually - but faster and more efficiently.

There are four types of robots, each designed for a different job.

### 1. Extract
Extract emulates real user behavior and captures structured data.
- <a href="/robot/extract/robot-actions">Recorder Mode</a> - Record your actions as you browse; Maxun turns them into a reusable extraction robot.
- <a href="/robot/extract/llm-extraction">AI Mode</a> - Describe what you want in natural language and let LLM-powered extraction do the rest.
