# Get Started

### Maxun Cloud

- Sign up at https://app.maxun.dev/register
- Choose your robot type:
   - Extract – show the Recorder what you want to capture. A robot will watch and learn your actions.
   - Scrape – provide the URL and let Maxun generate clean HTML and LLM-ready Markdown
- Name your robot and set it to run regularly, like daily.

That’s it! Most users create their first robot in about two minutes.
