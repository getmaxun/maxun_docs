# Stealth
Stealth mode helps your automations run more reliably on websites that use bot detection or anti-scraping mechanisms.

When enabled, Stealth applies additional techniques to make browser activity appear more human-like and reduce the chances of being blocked.

Availability
Maxun Cloud

Stealth is available on paid Cloud plans.

It can be toggled on or off per robot.

No additional setup is required.

Designed for production-grade reliability on dynamic or protected websites.

If you're on the free trial or free tier, Stealth is not included.

Maxun OSS

Stealth is not bundled by default in the OSS version.

If you are self-hosting, you can configure your own stealth setup using a Bring Your Own Proxy (BYOP) approach.

Please refer to the BYOP section for configuration details and recommendations.
