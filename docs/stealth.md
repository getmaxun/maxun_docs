# Stealth
Stealth mode helps your automations run more reliably on websites that use bot detection or anti-scraping mechanisms.

When enabled, Stealth applies additional techniques to make browser activity appear more human-like and reduce the chances of being blocked.


### Maxun Cloud

- Stealth is available on paid Cloud plans.
- It can be toggled on or off per robot and per run.
- No additional setup is required.
- If you're on the free trial, Stealth is not included.

### Maxun OSS

If you are self-hosting, you can configure your own stealth setup using a <a href="/byop">Bring Your Own Proxy (BYOP)</a> approach.

Please refer to the <a href="/byop">BYOP</a> section for configuration details and recommendations.
