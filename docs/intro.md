# Introduction
<span>✨ Turn any website into live, structured, LLM-ready data with Maxun ✨</span>

<br />
<br />

Maxun is a **no-code web data platform** for turning the web into structured, reliable data.  
It supports extraction, crawling, scraping, and search — designed to scale from simple use cases to complex, automated workflows.

## What Maxun Enables

### Extraction  
Turn websites into structured datasets and APIs, even across dynamic pages and authenticated flows.

### Crawling 
Automatically discover and collect data across entire websites with intelligent link following and scoped control.

### Scraping
Convert full webpages into clean Markdown, HTML and capture screenshots. 

### Search
Run programmatic web searches and extract results as metadata or full content, with time-based filtering.

Maxun is **no-code by default**, with optional APIs and SDKs when deeper integration is needed — without changing how extractions are defined.

👉 Continue to the next chapter to understand how Maxun works and how these capabilities are powered.
