# Introduction
<span>✨ Turn any website into live, structured, LLM-ready data with Maxun ✨</span>

<br />
<br />
Maxun is a powerful no-code platform for web data extraction. With its intuitive point-and-click interface, anyone can extract data from **any** website — no coding required. In just minutes, users can build automation robots to turn websites into structured APIs, spreadsheets, extract data at scale, and much more.

## What Are Robots?

Maxun uses web robots to power everything you can do on the platform. There are two types of robots, each designed for a different job.
