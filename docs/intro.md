# Introduction
<h4>Turn any website into live, clean structured data with Maxun</h4>

Maxun is an open-source no-code web data platform for turning the web into structured, reliable data.  
It supports extraction, crawling, scraping, and search — designed to scale from simple use cases to complex, automated workflows.

## What Maxun Enables

### Extraction  
Turn websites into structured datasets and APIs, even across dynamic pages and authenticated flows.

### Crawling 
Automatically discover and collect data across entire websites with intelligent link following and scoped control.

### Scraping
Convert full webpages into clean Markdown, HTML and capture screenshots. 

### Search
Run programmatic web searches and extract results as metadata or full content, with time-based filtering.

<hr />

Maxun is no-code by default, with optional APIs and SDKs when deeper integration is needed — without changing how extractions are defined.
